    <h1> My life </h1>
<p> 
      
        My name is Mohamed Ahmed. I was born in a big historical city in Egypt is called Giza, and I <br>have one brother and three sisters. I married in 2008, and I have two sons, Yassin and Yusuf. 
Yassin is the oldest one; he is ten years old. He started his fifth grade this year. Yusuf will turn <br>seven in this November, he is in first grade and he so excited because he started his real life as a first-grade grade. My wife is an assistant professor at the Ohio state university. <br>
I graduated from Education college, the University of Helwan in Egypt; after that, I accepted a <br>position at Delta Schools in Egypt as a social studies teacher for elementary and middle grades. In 2005, I became a high school geography and history teacher. <br>
Moreover, I became the supervisor of the social studies department in Delta schools. <br>
 At the end of 2008, I immigrated to the USA, and I worked in several jobs until 2012. <br>
 In 2012, I became an Arabic teacher in Mercy Islamic school in Oklahoma, and I taught Arabic <br>for elementary and middle school.

        Before 2013 my relation to computer science was very weak. I was only good to use the <br>computer, but I had no idea about programming and software. Then I decided to start a master in instructional design and technology in Oklahoma state university. Which it helps me to<br> know about some programs and software to facilitate teaching in the classroom. After I have finished nine credits hour, all of a sudden, I moved to Ohio. And I worked as an Arabic <br>teacher in zenith Academy from September 2016, At Zenith, I designed, supplemented, and modified curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of my classes second, fourth and fifth <br>grades. I designed a visual literacy club to provide basics knowledge about technology and some program such as Photoshop and video editing. More addition, I redesigned the Arabic <br>curriculum to use the technology in teaching Arabic. For, example, I used Photoshop and <br>adobe primer to visualize the Arabic content, and I trained the Arabic staff to use it <br>effectively in the classroom.
